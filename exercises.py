# In addition to practising functions, 
# we have a new way to "test" the work
# we have done. Through tests!
# When you complete each exercise, 
# the test should pass. 
#
# Your can take a look at the tests 
# in "test_exercises", but do not need to 
# change anything there.
# 
# To run the tests, you will need to install
# a couple of python libraries. You can 
# install this by running: 
# "python3 -m pip install -U --user pytest pytest-xdist".
# Once you have it installed: 
# You can run the tests with:
# "pytest -f --color=yes"
# from the terminal, inside this folder.

# 
# 1)
# Create a function named
# "triple" that takes one
# parameter, x, and returns
# the value of x multiplied
# by three.
# 

# 
# 2)
# Create a function named "subtract" that
# takes two parameters and returns the result of
# the second value subtracted from the first.
# 


# 
# 3)
# Create a function named "safe_subtract" that
# takes two parameters and returns the result of
# the second value subtracted from the first.
# If the values cannot be subtracted, it returns None.
# 

# 
# 4)
# Create a function named "greet_person". It should
# accept a string as an argument and return that
# string as part of a longer sentence that says hello: 
# i.e. "Sophia" --> "Hello, Sophia!"
# If the function is called with an argument that is
# not a string, it should return "Please provide a name."
# i.e. 5 --> "Please provide a name."
